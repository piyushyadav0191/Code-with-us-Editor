There are many great editor available on google; however, I didn't find one that has code syncing feature to code with friends, so I created this enhanced one. Code with us is a online editor which suits your needs -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* CodeWithUs can compile your code with ease 
* Code with your Friends with real Time code sync
* Markup editor to write Markups

Of course, no one editor will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
